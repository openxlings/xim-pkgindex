-- libnvvm — the NVIDIA CUDA redistributable component `libnvvm`.
--
-- WHY ONE PACKAGE PER UPSTREAM COMPONENT
--
-- NVIDIA publishes the toolkit as independently versioned components with a
-- machine-readable manifest (redistrib_<release>.json) carrying each one's
-- URL, size and SHA-256. Mirroring that split means a consumer installs what
-- it uses: a build that only compiles device code takes nvcc and its back end,
-- and does not take a 336 MB profiler.
--
-- WHY NO CROSS-COMPONENT `deps`
--
-- The set a working nvcc needs is not the same across releases. In the 12.x
-- line `cuda_nvcc` carries its own NVVM back end; in 13.x that became a
-- separate `libnvvm`, alongside `cuda_crt`, `libnvptxcompiler` and
-- `cuda_culibos`. `xpm.<platform>.deps` is declared per platform and cannot
-- vary per version, so encoding either shape here would be wrong for the other
-- line.
--
-- The closure is therefore discovered rather than declared: `nvcc --dryrun`
-- states the stages it will invoke and the search path it will use, and mcpp
-- reads that plan and reports the first stage that does not resolve, naming
-- the component to install. Knowledge of the vendor's component layout belongs
-- to the rule package that drives nvcc, not to this recipe.
--
-- VERSION
--
-- The version is upstream's, verbatim from the manifest's `version` field.
-- Two release lines are carried on purpose: the CUDA runtime a binary is built
-- against must not be newer than the host driver, and the driver is the one
-- component that cannot be redistributed. A machine whose driver reports CUDA
-- 12.4 builds against the 12.x line; 13.x requires a newer driver.
--
-- LICENCE
--
-- Upstream states `CUDA Toolkit` for this component. The URL below points at
-- NVIDIA's own distribution host, so nothing is re-hosted here.

-- WHAT GETS REGISTERED, AND WHY IT IS SCANNED
--
-- These components differ in shape, and the differences are not guessable:
--
--   cuda-nvcc        bin/ and nvvm/bin/
--   cuda-cudart      lib/ and include/, no programs at all
--   cuda-gdb         bin/, and one of its programs is named after the package
--   nsight-compute   NO bin/ -- `ncu` and `ncu-ui` sit at the payload root,
--                    beside host/ and target/
--
-- A hand-written list per component would be a table to keep in step with
-- upstream, and upstream has already moved files between components once
-- between the 12.x and 13.x lines. So the payload is scanned, in the four
-- places these layouts put things.
--
-- ⚠️ A PROGRAM NAMED AFTER ITS PACKAGE IS REGISTERED ONCE, NOT TWICE.
-- `xvm.add(package.name)` names the root, which is what `xlings use <pkg>
-- <version>` switches. `cuda-gdb` ships `bin/cuda-gdb`, so adding that as a
-- program as well trips xvm's duplicate-registration check and the whole
-- config hook fails -- which is exactly what CI reported before this. The root
-- therefore carries the binding when such a program exists, and is added bare
-- otherwise.
local function scan_dir(dir, kind)

    -- These components declare `linux` only, so one POSIX listing is the whole
    -- story.
    -- ⚠️ `-type f` WOULD SKIP SYMLINKS, AND SOME PAYLOADS SHIP ONLY SYMLINKS
    -- IN `bin/`. nsight-systems is that case: `bin/nsys` and `bin/nsys-ui`
    -- point at `../target-linux-x64/nsys` and `../host-linux-x64/nsys-ui`, and
    -- a scan restricted to regular files reported the payload as containing no
    -- programs -- which is what CI said, twice.
